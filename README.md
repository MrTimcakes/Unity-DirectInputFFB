This package allows you to easily integrate both the input and ForceFeedback features of DirectX from within Unity. This allows you to interface with HID peripherals with ForceFeedback capabilities. This can be used to build vivid simulated experiences.

The package will create a virtual device inside Unity's Input System. This device can then be used like any other device inside the Input System, allowing for easiy rebinding.
